This is because 9/11 was a horrific event that claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people. Making light of such a tragedy can be seen as disrespectful to the victims and their families, who are still grieving their loss. </p><p> For example, in the years after 9/11, there were a number of jokes that were made about the event. These jokes often made light of the tragedy, and they were often seen as being in poor taste. One example of a 9/11 joke that was widely criticized was a joke that was made by comedian Gilbert Gottfried. Gottfried joked that he had been asked to fly a plane into the World Trade Center, but he had refused because he didn't want to get his shoes dirty. </p><p> Jokes like this were seen as being disrespectful to the victims of 9/11 and their families.

It is important to be mindful of the context in which jokes are made, and to be respectful of the victims and their families. </p><p> Ultimately, whether or not jokes about 9/11 are appropriate is a matter of personal opinion.
