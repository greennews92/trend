Hackers and other cybercriminals can use the information that you share online to target you with phishing attacks, malware, and other threats. By managing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for criminals to access your personal information and compromise your security. </li><li><strong>Control:</strong> Managing your digital footprint is also about taking control of your online presence.
